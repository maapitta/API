# MySQL Folder

This folder contains files related to a MySQL database used by the APIs in this repository. The files include SQL scripts to create the necessary database schema and tables, as well as a Python script that establishes a connection to the MySQL database and performs basic CRUD operations.

## Installation and Usage

To use the MySQL files in this repository, you will need to have a MySQL database set up on your local machine. Once you have MySQL installed, you can run the SQL scripts in this folder to create the necessary schema and tables.

To use the Python script to interact with the MySQL database, you will need to have the `mysql-connector-python` library installed. You can install this library using pip:

```
pip install mysql-connector-python
```

Once the library is installed, you can run the `mysql.py` script to connect to the database and perform basic CRUD operations.
