# REST API 

This repository contains a collection of REST API examples that I have developed using Python and the Flask web framework. Each example is organized in its own folder, and includes a README.md file with a brief description and instructions on how to run the example.

## Running the examples
- To run any of the examples, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine using git clone https://github.com/maapitta/API.git.
2. Navigate to the desired example folder in your terminal or command prompt.
3. Install the required dependencies by running pip install -r requirements.txt.
4. Start the Flask development server by running python app.py.
5. Open your web browser and navigate to http://localhost:5000 to interact with the API.

Feel free to browse the examples and use them as a reference for your own REST API projects. If you have any questions or suggestions, please don't hesitate to get in touch.
